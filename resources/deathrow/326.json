Today I go home to the Lord. But first, I have to say something. I am real sorry. I took family member's life and I shouldn't have. I hope that you can move on. I am just sorry. I don't know what else to say. I can't bring anyone back. I would if I could. I hope you will be fine. I won't ask for your forgiveness. God will be my judge. To my family and friends, I love you all. You all take care and somebody find Void. Be strong and I will see you all; hopefully not soon. Keep your head up. That is all I have to say."}
