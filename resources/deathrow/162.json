And for affording me the opportunity that ya\u2019ll did. It made a real big difference in my life. I thank you. Thank you again from the deepest part of my heart. I\u2019m sorry. The biggest thing I wanted to say was to you and family and I know I haven\u2019t had a chance to talk with ya\u2019ll in any form or fashion or way or manner. And I regret what happened and I want you to know that I\u2019m sorry. I just ask and hope that sometime down the line that you can forgive me. I think in a lot of ways that without that it becomes very empty and hollow and the only thing we have is hatred and anger. I guess the only thing I have to say about the Death Penalty is that a lot of times people think of it as one sided, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s two sided. There pain on both sides and it\u2019s not an issue that people just sit there and voice off and say, well, this is a good thing, or this is a bad thing. But it\u2019s something that\u2019s, you know, needs to be looked at and desired in each heart. I just hope that all of you can understand that and someday forgive me. I want to thank ya\u2019ll for affording me the opportunity to talk and meet with ya\u2019ll. It meant so much. Thank you so much for being with me and my family. Thank you. I love you."}
