I thank my family, loved ones, and friends. I give Him thanks, honor, and glory. I love you Mary Taylor with all my heart, I always have. You are my girl. I love you, Michelle. You are my little kitten. Kevin, it\u2019s all you now. You are my boy. Sylvia, my sister, keep your eyes on Christ, forever. Everything is going to be okay. Angela Christine, keep your eyes on the prize and nothing else. I love all of you. God\u2019s been good. I would like to address the family: I offer my sorrow and my heart goes out to ya\u2019ll. I know you believe that you\u2019re going to have closure tonight and as I stand before God today, the true judge, I had nothing to do with the death of your family. I ask God to hold this. I would like to address the family of John T. Ford: I ask for forgiveness, because I do stand guilty for my involvement for that. Thank you Lord Jesus Christ for coming to my life. (quiet singing) Thank you Lord Jesus for coming into my life, you walked me through prison. Thank you Lord Jesus because you died for me. Thank you Lord Jesus for remembering me..."}
