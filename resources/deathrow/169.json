I said I could talk but I don\u2019t think I am gonna be able to. I heard one of your nieces had some angry words. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with the stay. I spent the last twenty years waiting to figure out what\u2019s going on. I pray that you get over it and that\u2019s the only thing I can think to say. I\u2019m regretful for what I done, but I\u2019m a different person from that time. If you could get to know me over the years, you could have seen it. I\u2019ve got some people over here that believes that."}
