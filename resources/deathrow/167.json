All I want to say is that when the state introduced my sister and my niece as state witnesses, it\u2019s not that they testified against me. The thing is, my lawyers would not subpoena anyone, so they allowed the state to subpoena them to paint a picture to the jury that my own sister and niece was testifying against me."}
