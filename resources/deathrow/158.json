Just want to say, uh, family, take care of yourselves. Uh, look at this as a learning experience. Everything happens for a reason. We all know what really happened, but there are some things you just can\u2019t fight. Little people always seem to get squashed. It happens. Even so, just got to take the good with the bad. There is no man that is free from all evil, nor any man that is so evil to be worth nothing. But it\u2019s all part of life, and my family, take care of yourselves. Tell my wife I love her. I\u2019ll keep an eye on everybody, especially my nieces and nephews. I\u2019m pretty good. I love ya\u2019ll. Take care. I\u2019m ready."}
