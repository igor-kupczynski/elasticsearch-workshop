He'll tell you the truth about what happened to your husband. I told Bubba to tell you what happened. Now, my statement to the world: I am in the midst of truth. I am good, I am straight, don't trip. To all my partners, tell them I said like Arnold Schwarzenegger, \"I'll be back.\" These eyes will close, but they will be opened again, my understanding of God is, Jesus has got me through. To my family, I love ya'll."}
