I love you!! Now I want to thank all of you that came here today to be with me. I know most of you are here to see me suffer and die but you\u2019re in for a big disappointment because today is a day of joy. Today is the day I\u2019ll be set free from all this pain and suffering. Today I\u2019m going home to HEAVEN to live for all eternity with my HEAVENLY FATHER JESUS CHRIST, and as I lay here taking my last breath, I\u2019ll be praying for all of you because you\u2019re here today with anger and hatred in your hearts letting Satan deceive you into believing that what you\u2019re doing is right and just. GOD help you, because what you\u2019re doing here today and what\u2019s in your hearts here today makes you no better than any man or woman on death-rows across this country. Today you\u2019re committing murder too!!! I pray on my own behalf for forgiveness for any and all of the pain I\u2019ve caused you, I pray that some day you\u2019ll realize your own mistakes and ask GOD to forgive you as I have, because there is no peace without GOD\u2019s forgiveness."}
