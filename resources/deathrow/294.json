I am sorry for what happened and that it was because of me that they are gone. If there were any way I could change things and bring them back I would. But I can't. Because of what I caused to happen many people were affected and I am very sorry that I did. I have made my peace with God and I pray that soon everyone will be able to have closure in their hearts and lives. To my family and friends, I love you and some day we will all be together again."}
