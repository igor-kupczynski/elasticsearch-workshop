I want everybody to know that I hold nothing against them. I forgive them all. I hope everybody I\u2019ve done anything to will forgive me. I\u2019ve been praying all day for Carl Levin\u2019s wife to drive the bitterness from her heart because that bitterness that\u2019s in her heart will send her to Hell just as surely as any other sin. I\u2019m sorry for everything I\u2019ve ever done to anybody. I hope they\u2019ll forgive me. \"Sharon, tell all my friends goodbye. You know who they are: Charles Bass, David Powell\u2026\" Then he coughed and nothing else was said."}
