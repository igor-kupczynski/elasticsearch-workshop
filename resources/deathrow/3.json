However, we as human beings do make mistakes and errors. This execution is one of those wrongs yet doesn\u2019t mean our whole system of justice is wrong. Therefore, I would forgive all who have taken part in any way in my death. Also, to anyone I have offended in any way during my 39 years, I pray and ask your forgiveness, just as I forgive anyone who offended me in any way. And I pray and ask God\u2019s forgiveness for all of us respectively as human beings. To my loved ones, I extend my undying love. To those close to me, know in your hearts I love you one and all. God bless you all and may God\u2019s best blessings be always yours. Ronald C. O\u2019Bryan P.S. During my time here, I have been treated well by all T.D.C. personnel."}
