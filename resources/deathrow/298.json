We came a long way through the tragedy - from hate to love and I would like to apologize for the pain I have caused all my families on both sides. I am looking at you Mr. Frank: I am sorry brother for what happened to your sister and I hope that you would forgive me one day. Ask God to forgive me and ask God to forgive you and allow me to pass through. My brother Farooq, I love you my brother and send my love to all my family members. And I was not a monster like they said I was. I made a mistake and this mistake cost - but they won't cost no more. I leave you with all my love and blessings. may Allah bless each and every one of you."}
